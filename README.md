# BFE Reborn
Banned Form Equestria Daily Reborn

# Why this project exits?
Due to original BFE android port only support up to android 7<br>
I decide to migrate this project to support new devices<br>
Current Target API:`Android 12(31)`<br>
Minium API:`Android 5 aka Lolipop(21)`<br>

# Where is the download link ? I need it for education purpous

:warning: This project only above Android 5 <br>
If your device is lower than this version. It's time to chage your device

[here](https://github.com/bradly0cjw/BFE/releases/tag/1.6) is you download link you such a horny person<br>
Recommend use arm-v8 variant<br>
if you can't install arm-v8 variant 
use arm-v7 variant instead(Cause its better compatibility)<br>
Almost every mobile manufacture after 2011 support arm-v7<br>
