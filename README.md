# Why doese this project exist?
The original BFE Android port only supports up to Android 7.<br>
Because of this, I decided to migrate the project to support new devices. <br>
> **Note**<br>
> Current Target API:`Android 12(31)`<br>
> Minimum API:`Android 5 aka Lolipop(21)`<br>

# Where is the download link? I need it for educational purposes. 
---
> **Warning** <br>
> This project only support Android 5 and above.<br>
> If your device has a lower version, it's time to change your device.

[here](https://github.com/bradly0cjw/BFE/releases/latest) is your download link, you such a horny person<br>
I recommend using the arm-v8 variant<br>
If you can't install the arm-v8 variant, the use arm-v7 variant instead because it has better compatibility.<br>
Almost all devices manufactured after 2011 support arm-7.<br>
